CTX Fryer TODO list
===================

If there's a committed change that implies further work on the same
or related topic done, it should be either done immediately afterwards
or put to this very list.

Note that this *doesn't* mean that commits that break things down
are allowed; commit must always leave the repo consistent.
However, sometimes a followup to a change is either needed or just
nice to have, although there's no time for an immediate action.
In such cases, the issue shall be put here so that it doesn't fall
into oblivion.

Also note that the list must be kept consistent with the code.
It should be as short as possible and ideally kept sorted by order
of the issue importance (most important first).


dynamic::mempool implementation
-------------------------------
Date: 2014/01/11
By:   vencik

Self-optimised concurrent access general purpose (?) dynamic memory
cache (aka allocator) shall be needed sooner or later.
Note that mt::mutex::trylock with timeout is already implemented.


dynamic::shared_ptr UT
----------------------
Date: 2014/01/15
By:   vencik

dynamic::shared_ptr has no UT so far.
Naturally, it should be tested in MT environment.

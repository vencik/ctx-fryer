CTX Fryer
=========

Multilingual & flexible CFL parser generator with support for grammar attribution

http://lopucha.net/ctx-fryer


WARNING
-------

Please note that the project is at the beginning.
It's not mature enough, yet.
It's already capable of producing working parsers, but there's a lot of work
ahead.
For instance, documentation (both user and development) is almost missing;
that's probably the next thing to focus on.
If you read this, I assume you might be interested in development of
the project since it's not really ready for a release.
If that is so, don't hesitate to contact the author (see Contact info, below).


Installation
------------

See INSTALL document in this directory.


Legal notes
-----------

The project is free software.

It uses several licenses: GNU GPL for the generator itself (the Perl prototype uses
Perl Artistic License).
GNU LGPL is used for C run-time support libraries (i.e. the code you need linked
to your program so that it does the actual parsing).
That's because the author doesn't want to limit the project usability only to
free/opensource software; proprietary software developers are people, too,
however ugly, smelly, unshaven...  Damn that mirror!

Support for other target languages should follow the same idea.

The above means in short that you can use and redistribute the project freely
and you are entitled to use the generated code and the real-time support libraries
in your project with no practical limitations except of honouring the author's
rights and committing any (reasonable) changes back to the community.

Of course, if you or your company decide to make a donation (however small)
to the project, the author won't be angry with you... ;-)
Other forms of support (web hosting, help with further development etc)
are welcome, too.

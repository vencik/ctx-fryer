CTX Fryer Installation Instructions
===================================

There's build.sh script in the project root directory.
The script will use GNU autotools and libtool to create configure script
and the Makefile templates.

The script then passes all its command line arguments to the configure script.
If successful, the configure script creates all Makefiles and the script
runs make to build everything and also make check to run unit tests.

The user is then instructed to run make install on his own (since different
privileges might be required for the installation).

The below is an example of typical development installation to a sandbox.
Documentation is not built (maybe you don't like to install asciidoc):

$ ./build.sh --prefix ~/test --disable-doc
$ make install


If you prefer to have more control over the process above, just run autogen.sh
by hand (that will produce the configure script), and then configure, make and
make install like you're used from any other project...

The example below does exactly the same as the previous one:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix ~/test --disable-doc
$ make
$ make check
$ make install


As shown above, the configure script accepts some options that affect what is
built and installed and what isn't.
Most importantly, you may decide not to install target language(s) real-time
support libs, since you might want to run the target code on a completely
different machine.

In cases you need to tweak the installation in any way, please read more about
the configure options in usage generated by the script itself:

$ ./configure --help
